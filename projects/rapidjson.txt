A json value can of 7 types. GenericValue is a variant type supporting these types. 
GenericValue contains a union with all the types as it member. A bit flag is there to denote type currently stored. 

GenericValue and GenericDocument are generic in sense that they can support any encoding. Value and Document UTF8 encoding.
